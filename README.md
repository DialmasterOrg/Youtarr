# Youtarr

Youtarr is a self-hosted application that automatically downloads videos from YouTube channels and integrates them seamlessly with your Plex Media Server, providing a curated, ad-free YouTube experience.

## Overview

In the era of digital media, ensuring safe and appropriate content for your children can be a challenge. Youtube, while being a vast reservoir of educational and entertaining content, also hosts content that might not be suitable for children. To strike a balance, Youtarr allows you to curate YouTube channels so that you can provide a vetted, customized and safe YouTube experience for your kids via Plex.

The application operates by running a scheduled task that automatically downloads new videos, along with their thumbnails and metadata, from a list of YouTube channels that you specify. These videos are then automatically added to your Plex server and a library scan is initiated as soon as downloads are complete.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **📺 Automated Downloads**: Schedule automatic downloads from your subscribed YouTube channels
- **🎬 Plex Integration**: If you link Plex, videos are automatically added to your Plex library with metadata
- **👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family-Friendly**: Create a safe, curated YouTube experience without ads or comments
- **🔐 Secure Access**: Local authentication system with admin controls
- **📱 Responsive UI**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **🐳 Docker-Ready**: Easy deployment with Docker Compose

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git
- Bash shell (Git Bash for Windows)
- Plex Media Server (optional; only needed for library refresh in Plex)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dialmaster/Youtarr.git
   cd Youtarr
   ```

2. **Run setup**:

   ```
