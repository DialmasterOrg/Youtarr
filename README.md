# Youtarr

## Description

Youtarr is a Dockerized application that offers a user-friendly way to automatically download videos from YouTube channels that you've handpicked, and integrates them seamlessly into your Plex Media Server.
Note that this is in no way endorsed by, or associated with Youtube or the Plex team.

## Overview

In the era of digital media, ensuring safe and appropriate content for your children can be a challenge. Youtube, while being a vast reservoir of educational and entertaining content, also hosts content that might not be suitable for children. To strike a balance, Youtarr allows you to curate YouTube channels so that you can provide a vetted, customized and safe YouTube experience for your kids via Plex.

The application operates by running a scheduled task that automatically downloads new videos, along with their thumbnails and metadata, from a list of YouTube channels that you specify. These videos are then automatically added to your Plex server and a library scan is initiated as soon as downloads are complete.

## NOTE: Work in progress.

In its current state, this application fulfills its intended functions and I anticipate it will prove beneficial for users with similar requirements. However, it's important to note that it remains a work-in-progress and not a completely refined product.

I openly invite any constructive feedback or suggestions for improvement. The journey of its development will continue, with the aim of introducing additional functionalities as the project evolves.

While the initial setup and startup process has been designed with a developer-friendly approach, it may not provide an equally seamless experience for the end user. I acknowledge this limitation and plan to address it in future updates, contingent upon user demand and interest.

Your engagement and feedback play a crucial role in shaping the future of this application. I look forward to continuously improving its functionality, usability, and overall user experience based on your needs and suggestions.

## Requirements

**This is designed to be run from the same computer that is running your Plex server as it needs direct access to write video files to the directory that you use for your Plex Youtube library**

To use Youtarr, you need to have the following software installed on your system:

1. **Docker & Docker Compose:** Youtarr uses Docker Compose to run the application and database in separate containers. Docker Compose is included with Docker Desktop. You can download Docker from the official website.

2. **Bash Shell:** Bash is a Unix shell and command language. The setup and start scripts are written in bash. For Windows users, you can use Git Bash, which is included when you install Git for Windows.

3. **Git**: Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is needed to checkout/download this repository.

4. **npm (Node Package Manager -- NOT REQUIRED FOR END USERS):** npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is used to install the dependencies that Youtarr needs to run in development mode. If you have Node.js installed on your machine, npm is typically installed with it. If not, you can download Node.js (which includes npm) from the official website

Please ensure that you have these installed and available in your system's PATH before you proceed with the installation of Youtarr.

## Key Features

- **Parental Control**: Vet the channels and control the quality and appropriateness of the content available to your children.
- **Ad-free Experience**: Running the content through a Plex server eliminates ads and potential exposure to inappropriate comments, enhancing the viewing experience.
  Automated Process: Set it and forget it. Youtarr will automatically update the Plex server with new content from the selected channels.
- **Easy to Use**: With a simple user interface and Dockerized deployment, setting up and running Youtarr should be straightforward for end-users, and will be improved with feedback. Docker takes care of most dependencies and setup.

## Disclaimer

While Youtarr provides a means to curate and download YouTube content, it's crucial to respect copyright laws and YouTube's Terms of Service. Always ensure you're in compliance with these guidelines when using the application.

## Plex Library Setup
**Special thanks to @DeanAtEC for helping me to identify this**

In order for Plex to properly pull in the poster images and metadata for the youtube videos, the Library setup to store the youtube videos should be setup as "Other Videos" and the Agent should be configured as "Personal Media"

## Usage

**You will first need to clone this repository.**:

**Before running this in either dev or production mode**: First run `./setup.sh`. This will let you select the root directory where Youtube videos that are downloaded will be placed.

### To run in production mode with Docker Compose (for most users)

#### NOTES:

**This has been tested in git bash on Windows with Docker Desktop. This is designed to be run from the same system as your Plex server.**
**When running in production mode with the above config, your Plex Server IP Address should be set to host.docker.internal**

**NEW: Youtarr now uses Docker Compose with separate containers for the application and database. This reduces the image size by ~60% and follows Docker best practices.**

This app uses Plex for auth. To login it will use Plex and then will verify that the Plex server on the local system is accessible to the Plex account you logged in to.

**You must login to Youtarr using the same Plex account that you use to administer the Plex server you want to use Youtarr with!**

If not you will be unable to login.

1. Run `./start.sh`. This will start both the Youtarr application and MariaDB database containers. The frontend UI will be exposed at `localhost:3087`
2. Once you are logged in, set your options in the Configuration screen and save them. You will want to select the Plex library that videos are supposed to be downloaded to, as well as the directory where they will be downloaded.
3. If you want to be able to browse videos from your subscribed channels from within the app, and initiate downloads of new videos that way, you will need to enter a Youtube API Key in your Configuration page as well.
   You can get an API key at https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials This is not required to run the app.
4. Once you set your download directory, you will need to restart the app. From the command line just run `./stop.sh` and then `./start.sh`
5. To view logs: The start/stop scripts will automatically detect whether you have `docker compose` (v2) or `docker-compose` (v1) installed and use the appropriate command. You can check logs with `docker compose logs -f` or `docker-compose logs -f`

   Each video will be placed in a directory named for the Youtube channel it came from.

### Upgrading from Previous Versions

If you're upgrading from an older version:

1. Pull the latest code: `git pull`
2. Stop the current setup: `./stop.sh` (this automatically handles both old single-container and new compose setups)
3. Start with the new setup: `./start.sh`

Your existing database in the `./database` directory will be automatically preserved and used.

## Login Troubleshooting

**If you find that you are unable to login to Youtarr and get an error message that says**: "_Invalid Plex Account. You must use the Plex account associated to this Youtarr server._"

You may have a Plex token that is incorrectly associated to Youtarr. You can fix this by "resetting" the token that Youtarr stores by:

1. Shut Youtarr down or stop the docker container.
2. Edit config/config.json, edit the line that says plexApiKey by removing the stored key. After you are done the line should look like: `"plexApiKey": "",`
3. Restart Youtarr and reload it in your browser.

## Docker Desktop Mount Path Troubleshooting (Windows)

**If you encounter this error when starting Youtarr**: `Error response from daemon: error while creating mount source path '/run/desktop/mnt/host/...': mkdir /run/desktop/mnt/host/...: file exists`

This is a known issue with Docker Desktop on Windows where mount points can become corrupted or orphaned. This typically happens when Docker Desktop doesn't shut down cleanly.

### Why it happens:
- Docker Desktop's WSL2 integration sometimes fails to properly clean up mount points
- The mount path becomes "stuck" and Docker cannot recreate it on restart
- More common with large directories or after Windows updates

### How to fix it:

1. **First attempt - Restart Docker Desktop:**
   ```bash
   ./stop.sh
   ```
   Then quit Docker Desktop completely from the system tray, restart it, and run:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

2. **If that doesn't work - Reset WSL2 mounts:**
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator
   - Run: `wsl --shutdown`
   - Restart Docker Desktop
   - Run `./start.sh` again

3. **Last resort - Full system restart:**
   - If Docker Desktop hangs when trying to restart, you may need to restart your entire machine
   - This will clear all stale mount points

### Prevention tips:
- Always use `./stop.sh` before shutting down Docker Desktop
- Consider disabling Windows Fast Startup (Control Panel → Power Options → Choose what the power button does → Uncheck "Turn on fast startup")
- Allow Docker Desktop to fully start before running `./start.sh`

**Note:** This is a Docker Desktop on Windows issue, not specific to Youtarr. If this problem persists, consider running Docker natively in WSL2 without Docker Desktop for more stability.


## UTF-8 Character Support

Youtarr now supports full UTF-8 characters including emojis in channel names and video titles. 

### For New Installations
New installations automatically use `utf8mb4` encoding and will handle all Unicode characters correctly.

### For Existing Installations
If you encounter errors like `Incorrect string value: '\\xF0\\x9F\\xA7\\xA1'`, your database needs to be upgraded to support 4-byte UTF-8 characters.

**Check your current setup:**
```bash
./scripts/check-database-charset.sh
```

## Accessing Youtarr from Outside Your Network

If you wish to access Youtarr from outside your network, or from other computers aside from the one you are running it on, you will need to forward port 3087 on your local computer firewall (Eg: Windows Defender Firewall) and on your router.

## Commit Messages and Versioning
