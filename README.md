## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git

- Plex Media Server (optional - only if you want automatic library refresh)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dialmaster/Youtarr.git
   cd Youtarr
   ```

2. **Run setup**:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh  # Select your YouTube download directory
   ```

3. **Start Youtarr**:
   ```bash

   ```

4. **Access the web interface**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3087`

       allow you to add and browse YouTube channels
   - If containers don’t start or the app isn’t reachable, see [Troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### For All Users
- **Storage**: Videos download to the directory you select during setup
- **Storage Growth**: Downloads can consume significant disk space over time. The UI includes a storage status chip that shows total and free space for your selected directory/drive, making it easy to monitor and adjust limits/schedule as needed.
- **Format**: Downloads as MP4 with embedded metadata for best compatibility
- **Filtering**: Automatically skips YouTube Shorts and subscriber-only content
- **Authentication**: Uses local authentication (create admin account on first access)

### For Plex Users (Optional)
- **Library Type**: Must be configured as "Other Videos" with "Personal Media" agent
- **API Key**: Get it automatically via Configuration page or [manually](https://www.plexopedia.com/plex-media-server/general/plex-token/)
- **Network Access**: Youtarr and Plex can run on the same or separate machines as long as:
  - Youtarr can write to the media location (local or network storage)
  - Plex can read from the same media location
  - Youtarr can reach the Plex API over the network
- **Network Storage**: Supports NAS, network shares, and mounted volumes
- **Docker on Windows**: Use `host.docker.internal` as your Plex server address

### For Platform Deployments (Elfhosted, Kubernetes, etc.)
Youtarr now fully supports platform-managed deployments with automatic configuration:

- **Auto-Configuration**: When `DATA_PATH` is set, config.json is auto-created on first run
- **Platform Authentication**: Set `AUTH_ENABLED=false` to bypass internal auth (when platform handles it)
- **Pre-configured Plex**: Set `PLEX_URL` for automatic Plex server configuration
- **Consolidated Storage**: All persistent data stored under single `/app/config` mount
- **Example**: `DATA_PATH=/storage/rclone/storagebox/youtube`
- **Details**: See [Docker Guide](docs/DOCKER.md#platform-deployment-configuration) for full configuration
