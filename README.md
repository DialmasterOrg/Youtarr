## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git
- Bash shell (Git Bash for Windows)
- Plex Media Server (optional - only if you want automatic library refresh)

### Installation

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Always use `./start.sh` to start Youtarr (not `docker compose up` directly). The start script configures required environment variables from your config.json.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dialmaster/Youtarr.git
   cd Youtarr
   ```

2. **Run setup**:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh  # Select your YouTube download directory
   ```

3. **Start Youtarr**:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```
   - Optional: run `./start.sh --no-auth` only when Youtarr sits behind your own authentication layer (Cloudflare Tunnel, OAuth proxy, VPN, etc.)
   - ⚠️ Never expose Youtarr directly to the internet when using `--no-auth`; always require upstream authentication

4. **Access the web interface**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3087`
   - Create your admin account on first access
   - If you want automatic Plex integration with library refresh, then configure your Plex connection
     - The app works fine without Plex integration and will still download videos from YouTube automatically and
       allow you to add and browse YouTube channels
   - If containers don’t start or the app isn’t reachable, see [Troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

### Using an External Database
- Already running MariaDB/MySQL elsewhere? Copy `config/external-db.env.example` to `config/external-db.env`, fill in your connection details, then either:
  - Run `./start.sh --external-db` (Docker Compose helper) or
  - Run `./start-with-external-db.sh` (single-container helper for platforms like UNRAID)
- Full walkthrough (including local testing steps) lives in [docs/EXTERNAL_DB.md](docs/EXTERNAL_DB.md)

### Deploying on Unraid
- Requires a running MariaDB instance reachable from the container. You can run MariaDB directly on Unraid or point to an existing server.
- Install the Community Applications plugin (if you have not already), then add the template repo URL `https://github.com/DialmasterOrg/unraid-templates` under **Apps → Settings → Manage Template Repositories**.
- Search for **Youtarr** under the Apps tab and launch the template. The XML lives at `https://github.com/DialmasterOrg/unraid-templates/blob/main/Youtarr/Youtarr.xml` for reference.
- Until the template is accepted into the main Community Applications feed, it is available directly from this repository.
- Map your persistent paths (for example `/mnt/user/appdata/youtarr/config` for `/app/config` and `/mnt/user/media/youtube` for `/data`) and supply the MariaDB connection variables before deploying.
- Set both `AUTH_PRESET_USERNAME` and `AUTH_PRESET_PASSWORD` so the container boots with working credentials. Leaving them blank requires completing the setup wizard from the Unraid host's localhost (e.g., via SSH port forwarding), which most headless installs won't have handy. You can change the credentials later from the Youtarr UI.

## 📋 Usage Examples

2. Set download schedule (e.g., every 6 hours)
3. Choose video resolution and download limits
4. Enable Automatic Video Removal (optional):
   - Toggle "Enable Automatic Video Removal"
   - Pick a free-space and/or age threshold

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### For All Users
- **Storage**: Videos download to the directory you select during setup
- **Storage Growth**: Downloads can consume significant disk space over time. The UI includes a storage status chip that shows total and free space for your selected directory/drive, making it easy to monitor and adjust limits/schedule as needed. Automatic Video Removal can purge old videos nightly at 2:00 AM once you configure age or free-space thresholds; space-based cleanup relies on the storage status chip reporting accurate disk usage.
- **Format**: Downloads as MP4 with comprehensive embedded metadata (title, genre, studio, keywords) and NFO files for maximum media server compatibility
- **File Management**: Videos must retain their `[youtubeid].mp4` filename and remain in their download location. Moving or renaming files will cause Youtarr to mark them as "missing"
- **Filtering**: Automatically skips subscriber-only content; configure auto-downloads separately for long-form videos, Shorts, and Streams
- **Authentication**: Uses local authentication (create admin account on first access)
- **Security**: Leave authentication enabled unless you have your own auth in front of Youtarr. If you launch with `--no-auth` (or set `AUTH_ENABLED=false`), never expose that instance directly to the public internet.

### For Plex Users (Optional)
- **Library Type**: Must be configured as "Other Videos" with "Personal Media" agent
- **API Key**: Get it automatically via Configuration page or [manually](https://www.plexopedia.com/plex-media-server/general/plex-token/)
- **Network Access**: Youtarr and Plex can run on the same or separate machines as long as:
  - Youtarr can write to the media location (local or network storage)
  - Plex can read from the same media location
  - Youtarr can reach the Plex API over the network
- **Network Storage**: Supports NAS, network shares, and mounted volumes
- **Docker Desktop (Windows/macOS)**: Use `host.docker.internal` as your Plex server address
- **Docker on macOS without Docker Desktop (e.g., Colima)**: Use the Mac's LAN IP (e.g., `192.168.x.x`) or `host.lima.internal`
- **Docker on Linux**: Use the host's LAN IP (e.g., `192.168.x.x`). `host.docker.internal` normally resolves to the Docker bridge and Plex may not be listening there.
- **Custom Plex port**: Plex defaults to port `32400`, but you can change the Plex Port field (or include the port in `PLEX_URL`) if your server listens elsewhere.
- **Library path translation**: When you pick a Plex library, confirm the suggested download path matches how Youtarr sees your storage (e.g., convert `C:\Media` to `/mnt/c/Media` on WSL).

### For Platform Deployments (Elfhosted, Kubernetes, etc.)
Youtarr now fully supports platform-managed deployments with automatic configuration:

- **Auto-Configuration**: When `DATA_PATH` is set, config.json is auto-created on first run
- **Platform Authentication**: Set `AUTH_ENABLED=false` to bypass internal auth (only when platform handles it). ⚠️ Never expose a no-auth instance directly; protect it behind your platform's authentication layer.
- **Pre-configured Plex**: Set `PLEX_URL` for automatic Plex server configuration
- **Consolidated Storage**: All persistent data stored under single `/app/config` mount
- **Example**: `DATA_PATH=/storage/rclone/storagebox/youtube`
- **Details**: See [Docker Guide](docs/DOCKER.md#platform-deployment-configuration) for full configuration
