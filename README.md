- **Filtering**: Automatically skips YouTube Shorts and subscriber-only content
- **Authentication**: Uses local authentication (create admin account on first access)

### For Plex Users (Optional)
- **Library Type**: Must be configured as "Other Videos" with "Personal Media" agent
- **API Key**: Get it automatically via Configuration page or [manually](https://www.plexopedia.com/plex-media-server/general/plex-token/)
- **Network Access**: Run on same machine as Plex server (the app must be able to write to the Plex library directory)
- **Docker on Windows**: Use `host.docker.internal` as your Plex server address
