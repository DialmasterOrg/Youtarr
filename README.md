## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git
- Bash shell (Git Bash for Windows)
- Plex Media Server (optional - only if you want automatic library refresh)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dialmaster/Youtarr.git
   cd Youtarr
   ```

2. **Run setup**:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh  # Select your YouTube download directory
   ```

3. **Start Youtarr**:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

4. **Access the web interface**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3087`
   - Create your admin account on first access

     - The app works fine without Plex integration and will still download videos from YouTube automatically and
       allow you to add and browse YouTube channels
   - If containers don’t start or the app isn’t reachable, see [Troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### For All Users
- **Storage**: Videos download to the directory you select during setup
- **Storage Growth**: Downloads can consume significant disk space over time. The UI includes a storage status chip that shows total and free space for your selected directory/drive, making it easy to monitor and adjust limits/schedule as needed.
- **Format**: Downloads as MP4 with embedded metadata for best compatibility
- **Filtering**: Automatically skips YouTube Shorts and subscriber-only content
- **Authentication**: Uses local authentication (create admin account on first access)

### For Plex Users (Optional)
- **Library Type**: Must be configured as "Other Videos" with "Personal Media" agent
- **API Key**: Get it automatically via Configuration page or [manually](https://www.plexopedia.com/plex-media-server/general/plex-token/)
- **Network Access**: Run on same machine as Plex server (the app must be able to write to the Plex library directory)
- **Docker on Windows**: Use `host.docker.internal` as your Plex server address

### For Platform Deployments (Elfhosted, Kubernetes, etc.)
Youtarr now fully supports platform-managed deployments with automatic configuration:

- **Auto-Configuration**: When `DATA_PATH` is set, config.json is auto-created on first run
- **Platform Authentication**: Set `AUTH_ENABLED=false` to bypass internal auth (when platform handles it)
- **Pre-configured Plex**: Set `PLEX_URL` for automatic Plex server configuration
- **Consolidated Storage**: All persistent data stored under single `/app/config` mount
- **Example**: `DATA_PATH=/storage/rclone/storagebox/youtube`
- **Details**: See [Docker Guide](docs/DOCKER.md#platform-deployment-configuration) for full configuration
