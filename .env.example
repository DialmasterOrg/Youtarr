# Youtarr Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and configure for your setup
# Example: cp .env.example .env
#
# IMPORTANT: After editing .env, you must completely restart your containers:
#   - Using scripts: ./stop.sh then ./start.sh
#   - Using Docker Compose: docker compose down then docker compose up -d

# ==============================================================================
# REQUIRED CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================================================

# Directory on the host machine where downloaded YouTube videos will be stored
# This path must exist on your host system before starting the containers
# Example Linux/Mac: /mnt/media/youtube or /home/user/videos/youtube
# Example Windows: C:/Media/YouTube (use forward slashes)
YOUTUBE_OUTPUT_DIR=./downloads


# ==============================================================================
# DATABASE CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================================================

# By default, Youtarr uses an internal MySQL database container.
# If you want to use an external database, uncomment and set the following variables
# To match your external DB settings
# Defaults are sets for internal DB use in docker-compose.yml

# Only override DB_HOST if you are using an external database
# Default is set to youtarr-db service in docker-compose.yml for built-in DB
# DB_HOST=192.168.1.100

# DB_PORT=3321
# DB_USER=root
# DB_PASSWORD=123qweasd
# DB_NAME=youtarr

# If you switch DB_USER away from root while using the bundled database container,
# edit docker-compose.yml and uncomment the MYSQL_USER / MYSQL_PASSWORD lines so the
# database service creates that user automatically.

# Only used for internal DB setup, can be omitted for external DB
# DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=123qweasd


# ==============================================================================
# OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================================================

# Youtarr service user ID and Group ID
# WARNING: Previously Youtarr ran as root (UID 0) inside the container
# It is RECOMMENDED to set these to a non-root user for improved security
# Default UID/GID is 1000 (typical first user on Linux systems)
#
# You will need to ensure that the following directories exist and that ownership of these
# directories matches the UID/GID you are using here.
#   config/*
#   jobs/*
#   server/images/*
# Create the directories if they are missing:
# mkdir -p config jobs server/images
# Ensure that directory ownership matches the UID/GID you set here.
# Example to fix ownership: (example YOUTUBE_OUTPUT_DIR of /mnt/c/my_youtarr_videos and UID/GID of 1000/1000)
# sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /mnt/c/my_youtarr_videos ./config ./jobs ./server/images

# If NOT set, defaults to running as root (UID 0) inside the container
# YOUTARR_UID=1000
# YOUTARR_GID=1000

# Authentication Settings
# Set to false ONLY if Youtarr is behind external authentication (VPN, reverse proxy with auth)
# WARNING: Never expose Youtarr to the internet with AUTH_ENABLED=false
# Default: true (authentication enabled)
AUTH_ENABLED=true

# Initial Admin Credentials (for headless/automated deployments)
# If not set, you'll create credentials through the web UI on first access
# And they will be saved to config/config.json (password hashed)
#
# Useful for container orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, automated deployments)
# where the UI may not be accessible via localhost
# NOTE: If set, these values OVERRIDE any username and password previously set through the WEB UI
#       and will continue to do so on each startup
# These must meet the following validation criteria or they will be ignored:
#   Username: 3-32 characters (no leading/trailing spaces)
#   Password: 8-64 characters

# AUTH_PRESET_USERNAME=admin
# AUTH_PRESET_PASSWORD=changeme

# Logging Configuration
# Options: warn, info (default), debug
# Use 'debug' for troubleshooting, 'info' for production, 'warn' for minimal logging
LOG_LEVEL=info

# Timezone selection:
# Controls when scheduled jobs and nightly cleanup tasks run
# Start scripts will prompt for this on first boot; default is UTC
# Use an IANA timezone such as America/Los_Angeles or Europe/Paris
TZ=UTC

# Docker Image Selection
# For development: Set to 'youtarr-dev:latest' to use locally built image
# For production: Use default 'dialmaster/youtarr:latest' (or leave unset)
# NOTE: Development scripts automatically set this, manual override rarely needed
# YOUTARR_IMAGE=dialmaster/youtarr:latest

# ==============================================================================
# NOTES
# ==============================================================================
# - Plex configuration is done through the web UI after first startup
# - For external database setup, see docs/EXTERNAL_DB.md
# - For platform-specific guides, see docs/ directory
